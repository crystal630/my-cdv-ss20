##Crystal's lab 1 assignment:

For this assignment I have learned the following things:

-Create google form and collect data (design a simple survey)
-Export JSON data and put the data in .js file (copy the code and paste it on script editor and run it. Then refresh the sheet and export the data)
-Calculate the average of data and use the average to determine the width of the bar
-Get more familiar about the Element and the connection between .js and .html

Problems:

-I didn't make a perfect survey. My survey is to check people's evaluation on different animated movies. But I didn't take into account that some people may not watch the movie before and I didn't set this option. And this issue could affect the final result
