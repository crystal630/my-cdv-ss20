This project, by Simon Scarr and Marco Hernandez, displays the world addiction to plastic bottles. It compared the accumulation of plastic bottles that people just bought in a period(an hour or a day) with the famous buildings to highlight the human heavy reliance on plastic bottles. This is a warning that it is time for people to reduce buying plastic bottles to protect the environment.

This data visualization project is created by Gabrielle Merite. The data is based on Williams Institute analysis on LGBT lack of protection by state nondiscrimination statutes, published on March, 2019. This visualization displays the population of LGBT people in each State by the size of circles, and it uses different colors to represent categories where LGBT are protected or not.
