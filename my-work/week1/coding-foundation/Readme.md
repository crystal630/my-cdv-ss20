##Crystal's reflection on the JS Exercise:

For this assignment I have gained a deeper understanding about the element and the connection between JS and HTML. For example, I Learnt how to create HTML Element in JS file and how to transfer the element to HTML. AppendChild is a new command for me and now I have known why and how to use it to build website.

One of my difficulties in this assignment is that I couldn't make the former squares disappear and the new squares just followed the former ones. So I asked Leon for help and he told me to append squares to a div and use .innerHTML=" " to make the content in div disappear. So I just made a blank div and appended the squares to it. Therefore, everytime I clicked the button, the former squares would disappear.
