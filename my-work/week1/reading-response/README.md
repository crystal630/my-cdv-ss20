1.Intro and Chapter 2: Why does Bowker say "'Raw data is both and oxymoron and a bad idea'" ? (pp. 663)

For me, it is easier to understand the quotation from this sentence: "to the contrary, data should be cooked with care". Combining the rest part of this chapter, I think the key to evaluate big data is how people regulate or use it and their purpose of using it. Especially nowadays big data are becoming more and more accessible which means there will be more uncertainty and potential issues on the privacy, safety and so on. Therefore, it is necessary to utilize data properly. Otherwise, if the raw data isn't used correctly, it might be the potential danger to us.

2.  "What could be meant by the quote "'accounting tools [...] do not simply aid the measurement of economic activity, they shape the reality they measure'"?

My understanding toward this question is that sometimes a new technique might have a revolutionary effect on the whole industry or system, not just a specific area. Big data is a vivid example. It is easier and quicker to get the essential pattern and achieve innovation and improvement from analysing big data, which could overthrow the traditional method to think and to work. And the gained methods sometimes can be applied to other related or similar areas. Thus,  in this quotation, accounting tools can shape the reality that people measure by getting the essence of the way people measure things.

3. In which way is Twitter data limited?

Firstly, Twitter is a social media, which means the source of the data is probably unreliable. Also, data from Twitter doesn't means objective or even fact. As the article says, lots of the accounts are robots and it is possible that a user can have many accounts and an account can be used by many users. Besides, the filter of Twitter could clean some data and this process is somewhat subjective. Thus the data of Twitter could be probably biased. Also, getting access to Twitter data concerns the privacy of the users. This issue has an effect on how large can a data set be and what question or topic they want to solve by the data. Since the boundary of privacy and publicity on the users' data is blur, it is difficult to determine whether Twitter data should be accessible to researchers or other people.

4. If you don't need to login to obtain certain data, then it is public and free to use. Or isn't it? Please share your opinion.

I think whether the data is public and free to use depends on the contributor's or the owners' will. Logging in or not is not the most important reason. Also, the related companies should get the permission about the access of data from the users directly.

5. Section 6: No prompt

This section mainly discussed the inequality on the access of data and the effect on researches. Companies with a huge amount of users could easily get the data and build their own database and they can use this data set to improve their own technology. For example, Google can use its users data to support its AI development even though I am not sure whether it is proper to do so. In the long run, large companies like Google will grow increasingly faster and cause a monopoly. Other poor companies cannot afford or unable to get the access of the data and the gap will be wider and wider.
